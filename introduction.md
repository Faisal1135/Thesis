## Introduction

Egplant is a the spongy,Berry Allen in botanical defination of fruit and a famous cuisines in bangladesh and other country .egg-shaped varieties of the eggplant's fruits are also known as garden eggs, a term first attested in 1811. The Oxford English Dictionary records that between 1797 and 1888, the name vegetable egg was also used.e most important,inexpensive and popular vegetable crops grown in
Bangladesh.
It is originated in India, as Subcontinent people are used to grow brinjal
since last 4000 years (Dunlop, 2006). Indo-Burma, China and Japan are
the secondary centers of eggplant origin (Gleddie et al., 1986). Arabs
introduced eggplant to the west during the 15th century (Hinata, 1986).
Eggplant germplasm resources and collections have been well documented,
evaluated and conserved throughout the world (Sarathbabu et al., 1999).
Currently, brinjal is extensively grown in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, U.A.E,
Sri Lanka, Egypt and other warm countries of the world. It is also grown in
Nepal, Japan, France, Italy, USA, the Mediterranean and Balkan area (Bose
and Som, 1986).

It is normally a self-
pollinated, diploid (2n=2x=24) annual crop that belongs to the family
Solanaceae (Thompson, 1951) a large plant family with more than 3,000
species and genus Solanum, a close relative of potato, tomato and pepper
(Spooner and Knapp, 2013; Barrell et al., 2013).

The yield potential of eggplant in Bangladesh is very low compared to other
countries due to the incidence of insect pests and diseases, which greatly
hampered the production of eggplant (Das et al., 2000, Rashid, 2000; Khan et
al., 1998). Eggplant is susceptible to several pests (fruit and shoot borer;
Leucinodes sp.) and diseases (Fusarium, Verticillium and Bacterial wilt),
nematodes (Meloidogyne sp.) as well as abiotic stress conditions (Kashyap et
al., 2003; Sihachakr et al., 1994). In contrast, the majority of wild species are
resistant to nearly all known pests and pathogens of eggplant and thereby are a
source of desirable traits for crop improvement. Plant breeders have addressed
these constraints by identifying resistant/tolerant germplasm, determining the
genetics involved and the genetic map positions of the resistant genes.
Comparative genomics and synteny analysis with closely related brinjals
promises to further advance the knowledge of the brinjal genome and provide
the breeders with additional genes and selectable markers for use in marker-
assisted selection.

Brinjal is grown on 17,28,271 ha with a total production
of 4,31,73,989 tons **(FAO, 2012)**. Asia has the largest
eggplant production which comprises more than 90% of
the world production area and 87% of the world
production. It is cultivated and available year-round in
Bangladesh with annual production areas of 124,214 ha
and the total production was 450,136 tons in the year
2014-2015 **(BBS, 2016)**. 


the eggplant
genome has not yet been extensively evaluated as for
the other solanaceous vegetables such as tomato, potato
and pepper, all of which have high density linkage maps
(Barchi et al., 2007; Jacobs et al., 2004; Tanksley et al.,
1992). Morphological, molecular and combined trait
analyses consistently recognized the main groups of
eggplants (cultivars and land races). It also exhibited
higher variation compared to the landraces and cultivars.
For eggplants landraces, morphological variability was
moderately high but low diversity was observed on SSRs
and combined data analyses (Caguiat and Hautea,
2014).
High degree of diversity of brinjal cultivars may be
attributable to genetic improvement programme based on
the molecular clustering patterns. It also provides support
for selection of crossing combinations from parental
genotypes and for broadening the genetic basis of
breeding programs. Due to having some medicinal values
particularly against cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular
disease, marker assisted breeding and production of
eggplant may contribute to enrich diets and bring health
benefits (Sultana et al., 2018). T
A much wider range of shapes, sizes, and colors is grown in India and elsewhere in Asia. Larger cultivars weighing up to a kilogram (2.2 pounds) grow in the region between the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers, while smaller ones are found elsewhere. Colors vary from white to yellow or green, as well as reddish-purple and dark purple. Some cultivars have a color gradient—white at the stem, to bright pink, deep purple or even black. Green or purple cultivars with white striping also exist. Chinese cultivars are commonly shaped like a narrower, slightly pendulous cucumber. Also, Asian cultivars of Japanese breeding are grown.

The eggplant belongs to the large family Solanaceae, which
compromises 3000 species with diverse genetic and pheno-
typic variation including tomato, pepper, and potato. Egg-
plants exhibit a wide biodiversity of local landraces/wild
relatives with huge variation respect to growth habit, patho-
gen resistance, and fruit size and color. The subgenus Leptos-
temonum (“spiny solanums”) comprises approximately 500
species, including three closely related cultivated eggplant
species: S. melongena (brinjal eggplant, section Melongena),
S. macrocarpon (gboma eggplant, section Melongena), and
S. aethiopicum (scarlet eggplant, section Oliganthes), which
are all of Old World origin and grown as food crops .
The domestication region of eggplant has long been debated;
two most commonly hypothesized regions are India and
southern China/Southeast (SE) Asia , where eggplant
use has equally old written records dating approximately
2000 years ago. Both of the hypothesized regions have highly
diverse landraces and populations of candidate progenitors
of domesticated eggplants (S. incanum L. in India and S.
undatum L. in southern China). Domesticated eggplant
exhibits substantial phenotypic differences from its wild pro-
genitors, reflecting rapid and pronounced evolutionary
changes. Identification of genetic changes underlying these
phenotypic differences will give insight into the genetic
architecture of complex traits, the response to selection, and
provide resources for eggplant improvement.
The availability of the eggplant genome **(S. melongena cv.
Nakate-Shinkuro)** **Ref** provides an excellent opportunity for
performing comparative analysis at the transcriptome level.
In recent years, various studies have been performed on
comparative transcriptomics to investigate molecular mecha-
nisms underlying disease-resistant, fruit-related traits and
develop molecular markers in eggplant **Ref**.
